I am an undergraduate student at Middlebury College purusing a B.A. in Earth and Climate Science. My primary interests are geomorphology and remote sensing. These interests are informed by growing up in Western Washington and volunteering as a mountain rescue responder. The combination of my academic interests, my sense of civic duty, and my field work experience draw me to study geologic hazards. I plan to get in M.S. in Geological Engineering to further my studies in slope stability and hillslope geomorphology.

This website was created for Open GIScience, a geography class I took my senior year at Middlebury. Many of the posts are reproduction studies I did for class assignments, but I have also added coursework from other classes.
