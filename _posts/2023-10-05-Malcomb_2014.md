Your final product from the workshop should be an extended blog post using the results and experience of this reproduction study to evaluate Malcomb et al (2014) in the framework of Tate (2013)â€™s assessment of error and uncertainty in spatial vulnerability models.

The blog post should make use of:

The Malcomb et al (2014) publication
The Tate (2013) publication (see next lesson)
The Malcomb et al (2014) https://github.com/HEGSRR/RPr-Malcomb-2014
