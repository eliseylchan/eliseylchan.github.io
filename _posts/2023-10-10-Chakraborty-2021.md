Despite achieving the same qualitative results of the original study (that PwDs are more likely to experience negative impacts from Covid-19 due to other demographic factors), the reproduction methods and exact results still deviated from the original paper. Even with intentions of making a study "open-source", poor enumeration of exact methods will prevent exact reproduction from being possible. The lack of description caused slight operational changes to the data. Bigger deviations include changing from a Pearson's to a Spearman's correlation to test the relationship between variables and verifying the Kuldorff spatial scan statistic by generating clusters with SatScan and Spatial Epi.

To improve the study and increase confidence in the numerical values assigned to counties, adjustments could be made to the clustering algorithm. The ability to reproduce Kuldorff spatial scan statistic was limited due poor control of the parameters used, so future reanalysis should employ an alternative clustering method such as gini-coefficient. Smaller counties ended up being weighted more than larger counties, so it would be valuable to find a statistical method that wouldn't do this.
