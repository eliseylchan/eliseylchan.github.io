What have you learned from doing a reproduction study?
Has the reproduction deviated from the original study in any way?
If so, are the deviations improvements or errors?
Are there opportunities to further improve the study’s research design, reproducibility, or reproducibility for teaching purposes?
Are there opportunities to design meaningful replication studies to further test any theories established by this study?
Keep in mind, a blog post is for highlights : aim for a post to be a short and impactful advertisement for the full study… no more than two paragraphs.
