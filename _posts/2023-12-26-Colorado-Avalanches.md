In the spirit of winter and hoping for snow in Vermont, I put my final project from Intro to Data Science in Fall 2022 on my Github. The assignment was to make four visualizations to explore a dataset of my choosing using R. I choose to look at avalanches during the 2021-2022 winter season in Colorado. I acquired data from Colorado Avalanche Information Centerâ€™s online [Observation Explorer](https://forecasts.avalanche.state.co.us/explorer/), which is free and open to the public.
